# TYLER'S PORTFOLIO

## Description

The goal of this project was create a website that acts as a portfolio to display all of the projects that I have made. It will be updated as more projects are completed and I learn more about coding.

Note: Some code was received through collaboration with BCS, specified in pushes to live.
